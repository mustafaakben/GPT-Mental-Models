## Background

### The Cognitive Science Foundation

Mental Models Theory (MMT), developed by Philip Johnson-Laird and colleagues, proposes that human reasoning operates by constructing and manipulating small, iconic representations of possible states of the world rather than applying formal logical rules. This theory has been validated across decades of cognitive psychology research and explains systematic patterns in human reasoning, including both successes and characteristic errors.

### From Cognition to Computation

This project implements MMT's core mechanisms as a neural network architecture. The key insight is that the principles governing human reasoning—sparse possibility representations, truth-only encoding, and staged inference—can serve as powerful inductive biases for machine learning systems. Rather than learning arbitrary feature combinations, our networks learn structured "worldlets" that mirror how humans represent and reason about possibilities.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Core Principles of Mental Models Theory

**1. Possibility-Based Representation**

Humans understand statements by constructing models of the situations those statements describe. Each model represents a way the world could be. For example, the statement "There is beer or wine" generates mental models:

```
Model 1: beer
Model 2: wine
Model 3: beer, wine
```

**2. Principle of Truth**

By default, reasoners explicitly represent what is true in each model and tend to omit what is false unless needed. This "truth-only" representation enables cognitive efficiency but predicts systematic reasoning errors when false information becomes relevant.

**3. Two-Stage Inference**

- **Stage 1 (Inspection)**: Fast, intuitive inference by reading off what holds in all current models
- **Stage 2 (Deliberation)**: Resource-intensive search that fleshes out implicit information and tests for counterexamples

**4. Cognitive Complexity**

Reasoning difficulty scales with the number of models required. Problems requiring many models or extensive implicit-to-explicit conversion are harder and more error-prone. This principle is summarized as "one model is better than many."

### Connection to Human Reasoning Patterns

MMT successfully predicts difficulty and error patterns across multiple reasoning domains:

- **Modus Ponens** (If A then B; A; therefore B) is easy because it requires only inspecting the explicit model
- **Modus Tollens** (If A then B; not B; therefore not A) is harder because it requires fleshing out implicit models
- **Probability judgments** show characteristic subadditivity patterns explained by possibility-based reasoning
- **Conditional reasoning** shows parallel semantics for factual and counterfactual statements

## Mathematical Framework

We formalize MMT's mechanisms using a structured calculus that can be implemented in both symbolic and neural forms.

### Worldlets and Model Sets

A **worldlet** $m$ is a consistent set of signed literals representing explicit knowledge:

$$m \subseteq \text{Lit} = \\{p, \neg p \mid p \in \mathcal{A}\\}$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set of atomic propositions. The **truth-only projection** extracts positive literals:

$$\tau(m) = \\{p \in \mathcal{A} \mid p \in m\\}$$

A **model set** is a finite collection of worldlets:

$$\Sigma = \\{m_1, \ldots, m_K\\}$$

### Completions and Supervaluation

The **completions** of a worldlet are all classical truth assignments consistent with its explicit constraints:

$$\text{Comp}(m) = \\{s : \mathcal{A} \to \\{0,1\\} \mid (\forall p \in \tau(m), s(p)=1) \land (\forall \neg p \in m, s(p)=0)\\}$$

For a model set: $\text{Comp}(\Sigma) = \bigcup_{m \in \Sigma} \text{Comp}(m)$

**Supervaluation** defines necessity and possibility:

- **Necessary**: $\Sigma \models \varphi$ iff $\forall m \in \Sigma, \forall s \in \text{Comp}(m) : s \models \varphi$
- **Possible**: $\Sigma \models^{\Diamond} \varphi$ iff $\exists m \in \Sigma, \exists s \in \text{Comp}(m) : s \models \varphi$

### Core Operators

**Generator** $G(\varphi)$: Constructs minimal worldlets from formulas (truth-only principle):

- $G(p) = \\{\\{p\\}\\}$
- $G(\chi \land \psi) = \\{m_\chi \cup m_\psi \mid m_\chi \in G(\chi), m_\psi \in G(\psi)\\}$
- $G(\chi \lor \psi) = G(\chi) \cup G(\psi)$
- $G(\chi \to \psi) = \\{\\{\chi, \psi\\}\\}$ (implicit: $\\{\neg\chi\\}$ cases left out initially)

**Merge** $\otimes$: Combines premises via consistent union:

$$\Sigma_1 \otimes \Sigma_2 = \\{m_1 \cup m_2 \mid m_1 \in \Sigma_1, m_2 \in \Sigma_2, m_1 \cup m_2 \text{ consistent}\\}$$

**Expansion** $E(\Sigma)$: Makes implicit possibilities explicit:

- $E(G(\chi \to \psi)) = \\{\\{\chi, \psi\\}, \\{\neg\chi\\}\\}$

**Inspection**: For monotone formulas $\psi$ (built from $\land, \lor$ without negation), define lower-bound valuation:

$$v_m(p) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } p \in \tau(m) \\\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Then: $\Sigma \vdash_{\text{ins}} \psi$ iff $\forall m \in \Sigma : v_m \models \psi$

### Complexity Metric

Cognitive cost scales with model count and underspecification:

$$\text{Cost}(\Sigma) = \alpha |\Sigma| + \beta \frac{1}{|\Sigma|} \sum_{m \in \Sigma} \text{unk}(m)$$

where $\text{unk}(m) = |\\{p \in \mathcal{A} \mid p \notin m, \neg p \notin m\\}|$ measures implicit information.

## Architecture

### MMTNet: Neural Mental Models

MMTNet translates the mathematical framework into a differentiable neural architecture for tabular classification.

#### Input Augmentation

Input features $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are augmented to represent both positive features and their negations:

$$x_{\text{aug}} = [x, -x] \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$$

This mirrors MMT's treatment of positive and negative information, with negations acting as "mental footnotes."

#### Worldlet Layer

The network maintains $K$ parallel worldlets, each representing a possible model:

**Gating Mechanism**: Each worldlet $k$ has learned gates $m_k \in [0,1]^{2d}$ (via sigmoid):

$$m_k = \sigma(m_k^{\text{raw}})$$

These gates select which features (positive or negative) are active in each worldlet. The second half of $m_k$ (corresponding to $-x$) represents negation gates, penalized during training to enforce truth-only bias.

**Positive-Weight MLPs**: Each worldlet processes gated features through a positive-weight network:

$$h_k = \text{ReLU}((x_{\text{aug}} \odot m_k) W_1^{(k)} + b_1^{(k)})$$

$$\text{logits}_k = h_k W_2^{(k)} + b_2^{(k)}$$

where $W_1^{(k)}, W_2^{(k)}, b_1^{(k)}, b_2^{(k)} \geq 0$ via Softplus reparameterization:

$$W_1^{(k)} = \text{Softplus}(W_1^{\text{raw},(k)})$$

This ensures monotonicity, aligning with MMT's inspection mechanism (adding true information never invalidates prior conclusions).

Per-worldlet class probabilities:

$$p_k = \text{softmax}(\text{logits}_k) \in \mathbb{R}^C$$

#### Dynamic Worldlet Selection

A small gating network computes per-example worldlet weights:

$$\pi(x) = \text{softmax}(\text{MLP}_{\text{gate}}(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^K$$

This allows different worldlets to activate for different inputs, analogous to context-dependent model construction in human reasoning.

#### Aggregation: Possibility and Necessity

The network combines worldlet outputs using two aggregation mechanisms inspired by modal logic:

**Possibility (Noisy-OR)**: Something is possible if it holds in at least one weighted worldlet:

$$q_{\text{poss}}[c] = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - \pi_k(x) \cdot p_k[c])$$

**Necessity (Weighted Geometric Mean)**: Something is necessary to the degree it holds across all worldlets:

$$q_{\text{nec}}[c] = \prod_{k=1}^{K} p_k[c]^{\pi_k(x)}$$

**Learned Mixture**: A learned parameter $\alpha$ balances the two:

$$q = \lambda \cdot q_{\text{poss}} + (1 - \lambda) \cdot q_{\text{nec}}$$

where $\lambda = \sigma(\alpha)$, followed by normalization: $q \leftarrow q / \sum_c q[c]$

#### Training Objective

The loss combines task performance with MMT-motivated regularization:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(q, y) + \lambda_K \cdot P_{\text{eff}} + \lambda_\eta \cdot \bar{m}_{\text{neg}} + \lambda_{\text{gate}} \cdot \bar{m}_{\text{all}}$$

where:

- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}$: Cross-entropy loss
- $P_{\text{eff}} = 1 / \sum_k \pi_k^2$: Effective number of active worldlets (encourages sparsity, "one model is better than many")
- $\bar{m}_{\text{neg}}$: Average activation of negation gates (enforces truth-only bias)
- $\bar{m}_{\text{all}}$: Average activation of all gates (feature selection pressure)

### Key Findings

1. **Competitive Performance**: MMTNet matches or closely approaches the performance of established ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and kernel methods (SVM-RBF) on all benchmarks.

2. **Consistency**: Standard deviations across folds are comparable to baselines, indicating stable learning despite the architectural constraints.

3. **Small-Data Efficiency**: MMTNet performs particularly well on smaller datasets (Iris, Wine), suggesting that the MMT inductive biases help with generalization when training data is limited.

4. **High-Dimensional Robustness**: On Breast Cancer (30 features), MMTNet maintains strong performance, with the gating mechanism effectively selecting relevant features.

5. **Interpretability Potential**: Unlike black-box ensembles, MMTNet's worldlet structure provides insight into which feature combinations (models) are active for different predictions, though full interpretability analysis remains future work.

### Statistical Significance

Differences between MMTNet and top-performing baselines are generally within 1-2 percentage points, often within the margin of statistical noise given the small dataset sizes. The key achievement is that MMTNet maintains competitive performance while respecting cognitive constraints (truth-only encoding, worldlet sparsity, positive monotonicity).

## Future Work

### Immediate Extensions

1. **Symbolic-Neural Hybrid**: Implement exact $G$, $\otimes$, $E$ operators with SAT/SMT backend for counterexample search, allowing the network to perform true deliberative reasoning.

2. **Interpretability Analysis**: Extract and visualize learned worldlets to understand which feature combinations constitute the "mental models" for different classes.

3. **Quantifier Layer**: Extend to first-order logic with set-worldlets for universal/existential reasoning over structured data.

### Medium-Term Goals

4. **Natural Language Reasoning**: Train encoders to map text (conditionals, syllogisms) to worldlets, testing MMT predictions on linguistic reasoning tasks.

5. **Visual Reasoning**: Apply worldlet architecture to visual question answering and scene understanding, where "models" represent spatial configurations.

6. **Causal Reasoning**: Implement paired actual/counterfactual worldlets for causal inference tasks.

### Long-Term Vision

7. **Differentiable Search**: Replace discrete SAT with learned counterexample detection, making expansion decisions differentiable end-to-end.

8. **Active Learning**: Use cognitive cost metrics to guide data collection—query labels for examples requiring many worldlets or extensive expansion.

9. **Transfer Learning**: Investigate whether worldlets learned on one task can transfer to related tasks, analogous to how humans reuse mental models across domains.

10. **Cognitive Modeling**: Fit MMTNet to human behavioral data (reaction times, error patterns) to test whether the learned representations match human mental models.
