Now, I have been  working on transforming this into a mathmetical and machine learning reasoning. Here is my work:



Below is a self‑contained, math‑first blueprint that turns core propositions of **Mental Models Theory (MMT)** into a formal calculus you can implement and extend into a learning algorithm. I’ll (i) formalize the representational objects (“worldlets”), (ii) define construction/semantics operators that capture MMT’s mechanisms (truth‑only encoding, implicit alternatives, counterexample search), (iii) give inference rules with proofs, (iv) treat major constructions (∧, ∨, →, quantifiers, modality/causality), and (v) sketch an ML‑ready parameterization and training objective.

I use standard propositional/FOL notation, plus a minimal three‑valued layer to model *truth‑only* partiality. All proofs are compact and focus on what you’ll need for implementation correctness.

---

## 1) Language and objects

### 1.1 Syntax

* Propositional base: finite set of atoms (\mathcal A={p_1,\dots,p_n}).
* Literals: (Lit={p,\neg p \mid p\in\mathcal A}).
* Formulas (\varphi) built from (Lit) with ({\land,\lor,\neg,\to,\leftrightarrow}).
* (Optional FOL) Signature (\mathcal L=(\mathcal F,\mathcal P,\mathcal C)) with variables, quantifiers (\forall,\exists).

### 1.2 Worldlets (partial iconic models)

A **worldlet** encodes only what is (currently) taken as *true*. Formally, we let:

* A **signed partial assignment** is a consistent set (m\subseteq Lit) (no (p) and (\neg p) together).
* Its **truth‑only projection** is (\tau(m)={p\in \mathcal A \mid p\in m}) (drop all negative literals).
* A **model set** (MMT’s “set of possibilities”) is a finite set (\Sigma={m_1,\dots,m_k}) of worldlets.

Intuition:

* (\tau(m)) are the explicit truths; negative info stays latent (a “footnote”) until made explicit.
* The **completions** of a worldlet are total classical assignments consistent with (m):
  [
  \mathrm{Comp}(m)={s:\mathcal A\to{0,1}\mid (\forall p\in \tau(m),,s(p)=1)\ \land\ (\forall \neg p\in m,,s(p)=0)}.
  ]
* The completions of a set (\Sigma) are the union: (\mathrm{Comp}(\Sigma)=\bigcup_{m\in\Sigma}\mathrm{Comp}(m).)

---

## 2) Semantics: inspection, supervaluation, and counterexamples

MMT distinguishes quick “read‑off” inferences from deeper counterexample search. We capture both.

### 2.1 Supervaluation (“necessary/possible”)

Given a classical truth relation (\vDash), define:

* **Necessary** (super‑true):
  [
  \Sigma \vDash \varphi \quad\stackrel{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\quad
  \forall m\in\Sigma,\forall s\in\mathrm{Comp}(m):, s\vDash \varphi.
  ]
* **Possible**:
  [
  \Sigma \vDash^\Diamond \varphi \quad\stackrel{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\quad
  \exists m\in\Sigma,\exists s\in\mathrm{Comp}(m):, s\vDash \varphi.
  ]

This realizes MMT’s “what holds in **all** possibilities” vs “in **some** possibility”.

### 2.2 Inspection (fast, truth‑only)

Let the **lower‑bound valuation** of (m) be
[
v_m(p)=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } p\in\tau(m),\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
]
Evaluate any **monotone** formula (\psi) (built from (\land,\lor), no (\neg)) under (v_m) classically.
Define:
[
\Sigma ;\vdash_{\textsf{ins}}; \psi \quad \stackrel{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\quad \forall m\in \Sigma:\ v_m \vDash \psi.
]
This matches the MMT idea that you can “read off” monotone consequences from what is explicitly true.

> **Lemma 1 (Inspection ⇒ Necessity for monotone formulas).**
> If (\psi) is monotone and (\Sigma \vdash_{\textsf{ins}} \psi), then (\Sigma \vDash \psi).

*Proof.* For any (m), every completion (s\in\mathrm{Comp}(m)) sets at least the atoms in (\tau(m)) to 1, i.e., (v_m \le s) pointwise. Monotonicity of (\psi) implies (v_m\vDash\psi\Rightarrow s\vDash\psi). Quantify over (m,s). ∎

**Takeaway.** Your engine can soundly return “necessary” for any positive formula verified by inspection alone—no search needed.

---

## 3) Constructing model sets from premises (the comprehension operator)

Define a **generator** (G(\varphi)) that builds **minimal** worldlets for each connective, reflecting MMT’s principle of truth (explicitly encode true parts; leave negated/irrelevant parts implicit). Then combine premises via a *merge* operator.

### 3.1 Merge of premises

For two model sets (\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2), define the **consistent union product**
[
\Sigma_1 \otimes \Sigma_2 ;=; {, m_1\cup m_2 \mid m_1\in\Sigma_1,\ m_2\in\Sigma_2,\ m_1\cup m_2 \text{ consistent},}.
]
For premises (\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n), the comprehension state is:
[
\Sigma_P ;=; G(\varphi_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes G(\varphi_n).
]

### 3.2 Generator (G) (minimal, truth‑only)

For atoms and Boolean connectives:

* **Atom** (p): (G(p)={{p}}).
* **Negation** (\neg \chi): (G(\neg \chi)={{\neg \chi}})  *(stored but dropped by (\tau) during inspection; becomes active during search)*.
* **Conjunction** (\chi\land\psi): (G(\chi\land\psi)={m_\chi\cup m_\psi \mid m_\chi\in G(\chi), m_\psi\in G(\psi)}).
* **Disjunction** (\chi\lor\psi): (G(\chi\lor\psi)=G(\chi)\ \cup\ G(\psi)\ \cup\ (\text{optional } {m_\chi\cup m_\psi})).
* **Conditional** (\chi\to\psi): (G(\chi\to\psi)={; {,\chi,\ \psi,};})
  (MMT’s explicit case “(\chi) and (\psi)”; “(\neg\chi)” cases are left implicit initially.)
* **Biconditional** (\chi\leftrightarrow \psi): (G(\chi\leftrightarrow \psi)={{\chi,\psi},{\neg\chi,\neg\psi}}).

> **Remark.** Keeping (\neg) inside worldlets does **not** violate the truth‑only *use* at inspection time, because inspection applies (\tau) and ignores negative literals. The negatives become active in the deliberative phase.

---

## 4) Deliberation: explicitating missing possibilities (expansion) & counterexamples

### 4.1 Expansion operator (E)

Add the “omitted” possibilities demanded by the connective’s full meaning.

Inductively define (E(G(\varphi))) as the smallest superset of (G(\varphi)) such that:

* (E(G(p))=G(p)).
* (E(G(\neg\chi))=G(\neg\chi)).
* (E(G(\chi\land\psi)) = {m_\chi\cup m_\psi\mid m_\chi\in E(G(\chi)), m_\psi\in E(G(\psi))}).
* (E(G(\chi\lor\psi)) = E(G(\chi))\ \cup\ E(G(\psi))\ \cup{m_\chi\cup m_\psi\mid m_\chi\in E(G(\chi)), m_\psi\in E(G(\psi))}).
* (E(G(\chi\to\psi)) = {{\chi,\psi},{\neg\chi}}).
* (E(G(\chi\leftrightarrow\psi))) as above (already explicit).

**Premise set:** (E(\Sigma_P) := E(G(\varphi_1))\otimes\cdots\otimes E(G(\varphi_n))).

> **Theorem 2 (Classical adequacy of full expansion).**
> The completions of (E(\Sigma_P)) are exactly the classical models of the premise set (P):
> [
> \mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma_P))\ =\ {, s \mid s\vDash \varphi_1\land\cdots\land\varphi_n ,}.
> ]

*Proof sketch.* Structural induction on the formulas using the expansion clauses:

* For (\lor), union and joint case give all satisfying assignments.
* For (\to), ({\chi,\psi}) covers the ( \chi\land \psi) region; ({\neg\chi}) covers both (\neg\chi\land\psi) and (\neg\chi\land\neg\psi). The falsifying region (\chi\land\neg\psi) is not included, so completions coincide with classical models of (\neg\chi\lor\psi).
* (\land), (\leftrightarrow) are straightforward.
  Closure under (\otimes) preserves intersections of satisfying assignments. ∎

### 4.2 Counterexample search

Given a candidate conclusion (\theta), a **counterexample** is (s\in \mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma_P))) with (s\nvDash \theta). Search can be staged:

1. Try (s\in \mathrm{Comp}(\Sigma_P)) (no expansion);
2. If none, expand selective connectives: (\Sigma_P^{(1)}\subseteq E(\Sigma_P));
3. If still none, take (E(\Sigma_P)) (complete).

> **Proposition 3 (Completeness of deliberation).**
> If no counterexample exists in (\mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma_P))), then (P\vDash \theta) classically.

*Proof.* By Thm. 2, (\mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma_P))) is exactly the set of classical models of (P). ∎

---

## 5) Worked logic patterns (with proofs)

### 5.1 Modus Ponens (easy by inspection)

Premises (P={\chi\to\psi,\ \chi}).

* (G(\chi\to\psi)={{\chi,\psi}}), (G(\chi)={{\chi}}).
* Merge: (\Sigma_P= {{\chi,\psi}}) (the other pairing is inconsistent).
* Inspection: (v_m(\chi)=v_m(\psi)=1\Rightarrow \psi) holds for the (monotone) literal (\psi).
  By Lemma 1, (\Sigma_P\vDash \psi).

### 5.2 Modus Tollens (requires expansion)

Premises (P={\chi\to\psi,\ \neg \psi}).

* (G(\chi\to\psi)={{\chi,\psi}}), (G(\neg\psi)={{\neg\psi}}).
* Merge without expansion is inconsistent (no model).
* Expand the conditional: (E(G(\chi\to\psi))={{\chi,\psi},{\neg\chi}}).
* Merge: only ({\neg\chi,\neg\psi}) survives.
  Inspection (truth‑only) can’t read off (\neg\chi); deliberation returns **necessary** (\neg\chi) (no completion makes (\chi) true).
  Formally, (\mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma_P))={s\mid s(\chi)=0,s(\psi)=0}\Rightarrow \vDash \neg\chi).

### 5.3 Fallacies

* **Affirming the consequent** ((\chi\to\psi,\ \psi \vdash \chi)?)
  Expansion gives ({{\chi,\psi},{\neg\chi}}) merged with ({{\psi}}) → worldlets ({\chi,\psi}) and ({\neg\chi,\psi}). There exist completions with (\neg\chi), so (\chi) is not necessary.
* **Denying the antecedent** ((\chi\to\psi,\ \neg\chi \vdash \neg\psi)?)
  With ({\neg\chi}) and the expanded conditional, completions include both (\neg\chi\land\psi) and (\neg\chi\land\neg\psi). So (\neg\psi) is not necessary.

---

## 6) Quantifiers and set‑models

Introduce a (possibly unknown) domain (D\neq\varnothing). Each unary predicate (P) is a set (S_P\subseteq D). A **set‑worldlet** stores:

* Positive memberships (W^+ \subseteq {(P,a)\in \mathcal P\times \mathcal C^*}) (witnesses).
* **Structural constraints** (C) among sets (e.g., (S_A\subseteq S_C)).
  A completion chooses (D), all (S_P\subseteq D) consistent with (W^+) and (C).

Generator rules:

* (G(\exists x,P(x))={{P(a)}}) with fresh Skolem (a).
* (G(\forall x (A(x)\to C(x)))) encodes the **subset constraint** (S_A\subseteq S_C); no witnesses required initially.
* (G(\text{Most}(A,C))) encodes (|S_A\cap S_C| > |S_A\setminus S_C|) (a cardinality constraint).
* Merge and expansion behave as before (witnesses can be introduced during search as needed).

> **Lemma 4 (Read‑off for existential).**
> From (G(\exists x,P(x))) you may inspectively infer (\exists x,P(x)) (the witness is explicitly present).

> **Lemma 5 (Why universals are harder).**
> (G(\forall x (A!\to!C))) supplies only a structural constraint; inspection (which uses (\tau)) has no positive witness to read off new literals about individuals. Deliberation (search over completions) is required for many universal conclusions.

---

## 7) Modal and causal notions (optional layer)

Add two modal predicates over (\Sigma):

* **Necessity** (\Box \phi) iff (\Sigma \vDash \phi).
* **Possibility** (\Diamond \phi) iff (\Sigma \vDash^\Diamond \phi).

Causality (sketch): Introduce event variables with partial orders (t(e)) and structural constraints.

* **Enable** (\mathrm{En}(A,C)): completions respect that in contexts where (A) occurs (and no blockers), (C) is *possible* and “easier”.
* **Cause** (\mathrm{Ca}(A,C)): completions enforce both sufficiency (contexts with (A\Rightarrow) (C)) and a counterfactual tendency (in otherwise‑similar completions with (\neg A), (C) tends not to occur). You can implement this as paired constraints over two coupled completions (actual vs. counterfactual).

---

## 8) Complexity and “one‑model is better than many”

Let (#(\Sigma)=|\Sigma|) and for (m), let (\mathrm{unk}(m)=|{p\in\mathcal A\mid p\notin m,\ \neg p\notin m}|). Define a **cognitive cost**:
[
\mathsf{Cost}(\Sigma)=\alpha,#(\Sigma) + \beta,\frac{1}{#(\Sigma)}\sum_{m\in\Sigma}\mathrm{unk}(m),
]
with (\alpha,\beta>0). (First term penalizes many cases; second penalizes heavy underspecification when deep search is needed.)

> **Proposition 6 (Case‑split bound).**
> For a propositional formula with (d) syntactic (\lor)-splits and (c) (\to)-splits,
> [
> |E(G(\varphi))|\ \le\ 2^d\cdot 2^c,
> ]
> and (|G(\varphi))|\le 2^d) (since (\to) contributes only one explicit case initially).

*Proof.* Direct from the expansion clauses. ∎

---

## 9) Probabilities from possibilities

Let (\pi) be a distribution over worldlets ((\pi(m)\ge 0,\ \sum_m \pi(m)=1)).
Within each worldlet, spread mass uniformly over completions that vary only on unknown atoms:
[
\mu_m(s)\ \propto\ \mathbb 1[s\in\mathrm{Comp}(m)].
]
Define model‑based probability:
[
\mathbb P(\phi \mid \Sigma,\pi);=;\sum_{m\in\Sigma}\pi(m)\cdot \mathbb P_{s\sim \mu_m}[,s\vDash \phi,].
]

> **Proposition 7 (Rough‑average property for disjunctions).**
> If (G(A\lor B)={{A},{B}}) (omit the joint case in the explicit phase), then
> [
> \mathbb P(A\lor B)\ \approx\ \tfrac12\big(\mathbb P(A)+\mathbb P(B)\big)
> ]
> whenever (\pi({A})\approx \pi({B})) and completions are near‑uniform.
> (Adding the joint worldlet shifts the estimate upward toward inclusion–exclusion.)

*Sketch.* Each worldlet contributes the probability of its focal literal; averaging over ({A}) and ({B}) yields the rough mean. ∎

---

## 10) ML‑ready parametrization (“Differentiable Mental‑Model Calculus”, DMMC)

### 10.1 Latent state

* Fix (K) maximum worldlets. Represent them by matrices (Z\in{1,0,\bot}^{K\times n}) over atoms (\mathcal A), where row (k) is worldlet (m_k) with entries (1) (= (p)), (0) (= (\neg p)), (\bot) (= unknown).
* Maintain logits (\ell\in\mathbb R^{K\times n\times 3}) and a Gumbel‑Softmax to sample/relax to (Z).

### 10.2 Construction/inference modules

* **Encoder** (E_\theta(x)\to Z): amortized comprehension from input (x) (text, scene, etc.).
* **Inspection head** computes (v_{m_k}) and evaluates monotone targets;
* **Expansion module** (S_\phi) (symbolic or neural‑guided) applies (E) rules as needed;
* **Counterexample search** reduces to SAT/SMT on (\mathrm{Comp}(Z)) with learned heuristics.

### 10.3 Objectives

* **Task loss** (supervised): cross‑entropy on gold necessary/possible labels, QA, etc., computed via supervaluation on (expanded) (\Sigma).
* **Regularizer (MMT prior)**:
  [
  \mathcal L_{\text{MMT}}=\lambda_1,#(\Sigma) + \lambda_2,\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k}\mathrm{unk}(m_k) + \lambda_3,\mathrm{ExpCost},
  ]
  where (\mathrm{ExpCost}) counts how often expansions were needed (pressure toward “one model is better than many” and “truth‑only” sparsity).
* **Probabilistic head**: learn (\pi) by a softmax over worldlet scores; train with Brier/CE loss on probabilistic judgments.

### 10.4 Differentiable semantics (for backprop)

For monotone queries (\psi), use Lemma 1 and replace hard (v_m) by relaxed truth vectors (\hat v_m\in[0,1]^n) (prob. of being in (\tau(m))); evaluate (\psi) with a t‑norm/t‑conorm calculus:
[
\widehat{\psi\land\phi}=\hat\psi\cdot \hat\phi,\quad \widehat{\psi\lor\phi}=\hat\psi+\hat\phi-\hat\psi\hat\phi.
]
For general (\varphi), let the expansion/search operate in discrete space but backprop via a straight‑through estimator or a learned surrogate that predicts the counterexample existence.

---

## 11) Compact “Spec Sheet” of the theory in math

**Axioms (MMT‑Style)**

1. **Possibility representation.** Reasoning state is a finite (\Sigma={m_1,\dots,m_K}) of worldlets (m\subseteq Lit).
2. **Truth‑only principle.** Quick inferences use (\tau(\Sigma)) only.
3. **Construction.** (G) defines minimal worldlets for premises; premises combine via (\otimes).
4. **Inspection.** For monotone (\psi): if (\forall m\in\Sigma,\ v_m\vDash \psi), then (\Sigma\vDash \psi).
5. **Deliberation.** Expand with (E); necessity is evaluated by supervaluation over (\mathrm{Comp}(E(\Sigma))).
6. **Complexity.** Costs increase in (#(\Sigma)) and needed expansion depth; systems prefer lower cost consistent with goals.
7. **Knowledge modulation.** Background constraints (K) restrict allowable completions: replace (\mathrm{Comp}(\cdot)) by (\mathrm{Comp}_K(\cdot)={s\in\mathrm{Comp}(\cdot)\mid s\vDash K}).

**Key Theorems**

* Lemma 1 (Inspection ⇒ Necessity for monotone).
* Theorem 2 (Classical adequacy of full expansion).
* Proposition 3 (Completeness of deliberation via counterexample search).
* Proposition 6 (Case‑split bound).
* Optional: probabilistic rough‑average property (Prop. 7).

---

## 12) Example end‑to‑end (symbolic)

Premises:
(\varphi_1:) “If metal then conducts” (M\to C).
(\varphi_2:) “Not conducts” (\neg C).

* (G(\varphi_1)={{M,C}}), (G(\varphi_2)={{\neg C}}).
* (\Sigma = G(\varphi_1)\otimes G(\varphi_2) = \emptyset) (inconsistent) → **need expansion**.
* (E(G(\varphi_1))={{M,C},{\neg M}}).
* (E(\Sigma) = {{\neg M,\neg C}}).
* Completions force (\neg M) ⇒ necessary (\neg M) (Modus Tollens).

---

## 13) Implementation notes

* Represent (m) as a **ternary tensor** over atoms: (1)(true), (0)(false), (\bot)(unknown).
* (\otimes) is a masked broadcast‑union with consistency checks.
* (E) can be coded as a set of rewrite templates; apply on demand (budgeted by (\mathsf{Cost})).
* SAT/SMT backends can witness counterexamples from (E(\Sigma)) fast; you only need to encode (\mathrm{Comp}) constraints.

---

### What you can build next

1. A **symbolic core** (exact (G,\otimes,E), SAT search).
2. A **neural encoder** to propose (Z) from text/images.
3. A **training loop** that rewards correct necessary/possible judgments while minimizing (\mathsf{Cost}).
4. **Ablations**: toggle expansion depth; measure error patterns (MP easy; MT harder; AC/DN invalid) to validate MMT fingerprints.

If you share your target task (e.g., natural‑language syllogisms, visual reasoning, robot planning), I can instantiate the atoms, the precise (G) tables (including quantifiers/causals needed), and deliver pseudocode for (G,\otimes,E), inspection, and counterexample search tailored to that domain.
